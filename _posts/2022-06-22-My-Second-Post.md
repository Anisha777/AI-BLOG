# Python- Programming language for AI

#### Introduction to Python Programming

>Python is an object-oriented, high-level, dynamically semantic programming language. It is extremely appealing for rapid application development due to its high-level built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Python's straightforward syntax prioritizes readability and makes it simple to learn, which lowers the cost of program maintenance. It supports modules and packages, which encourages modularity and code reuse of the program. For all popular platforms, the Python interpreter and the comprehensive standard library are freely distributable and available in source or binary form.


#### Feature of Python Programming

>Python can be referred to as a "interpreted language," which, put simply, means that it can be used by the programmer directly to run the program without needing to be first translated into machine language instructions. As a result, it is a sufficient language for usage with an emulator or virtual machine that is based on the native code of an existent machine, which is the language that hardware can understand.<br><br>This high-level programming language is used in challenging situations. In order to be more comprehensive and hence expand their use, high-level languages support arrays, variables, objects, complex arithmetic, Boolean expressions, and other abstract ideas in computer science.<br><br>Python also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management that support a variety of programming paradigms, including procedural, imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming, to name a few.<br><br>Every operating system can use Python, and its open-source counterpart, CPython, is rapidly gaining popularity.








#### Why is python in need for Artificial Intelligence?

>**Python is the most basic programming language available and is actually only one-fifth of other OOP languages. It is currently one of the most widely used languages in business because of this.<br><br>Python is in need for Artificial Intelligence due to following properties:**<br><br> **Supporting Libraries** <br>*Python comes with Prebuilt Libraries such as Numpy to do scientific calculations, Scipy for advanced computing, and Pybrain for machine learning (Python Machine Learning), making it among the top languages for AI.*<br><br>**Portability**<br>*Python is platform-independent and hence is among the most versatile and well-known solutions for numerous platforms and technologies, with few alterations to the foundations of coding.*<br><br>**Quality of Software**<br>*Python offers the greatest flexibility among other programs, with the option of choosing among OOPs technique and scripting.*<br><br>**Fun to Use**<br>
*Python is simple and supports a lot of libraries. It is easy to learn thus makes any programmer fun-loving.*
<br><br>**Productivity of Developers**<br>*Python is easy to debug as its code is aound one-fifth of other Object Oriented Programming.Thus, Programmers can save their time to code with effective result.*


#### Summary
 
>Python is an important programming language for AI because it includes strong frameworks, such as Machine Learning in Python, which satisfies practically all of the standards in this field. It is one of the easiest and most effective visualization tools available.
AI demands a lot of studies to test an innovative idea but another programming language will never be able to accomplish the project successfully. With twenty to thirty lines of code, almost any concept can be validated in Python. This makes it an incredibly helpful language for advancing AI.<br><br>Python is the best AI programming language, and this makes it obvious. Python offers relevance for many additional objectives in addition to being the best AI programming language.
