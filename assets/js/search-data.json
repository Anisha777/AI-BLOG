            "content": "Python- Programming language for AI . Introduction to Python Programming . Python is an object-oriented, high-level, dynamically semantic programming language. It is extremely appealing for rapid application development due to its high-level built-in data structures, dynamic typing, and dynamic binding. Python’s straightforward syntax prioritizes readability and makes it simple to learn, which lowers the cost of program maintenance. It supports modules and packages, which encourages modularity and code reuse of the program. For all popular platforms, the Python interpreter and the comprehensive standard library are freely distributable and available in source or binary form. . Feature of Python Programming . Python can be referred to as a “interpreted language,” which, put simply, means that it can be used by the programmer directly to run the program without needing to be first translated into machine language instructions. As a result, it is a sufficient language for usage with an emulator or virtual machine that is based on the native code of an existent machine, which is the language that hardware can understand.This high-level programming language is used in challenging situations. In order to be more comprehensive and hence expand their use, high-level languages support arrays, variables, objects, complex arithmetic, Boolean expressions, and other abstract ideas in computer science.Python also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management that support a variety of programming paradigms, including procedural, imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming, to name a few.Every operating system can use Python, and its open-source counterpart, CPython, is rapidly gaining popularity. . Why is python in need for Artificial Intelligence? . Python is the most basic programming language available and is actually only one-fifth of other OOP languages. It is currently one of the most widely used languages in business because of this.Python is in need for Artificial Intelligence due to following properties: Supporting Libraries Python comes with Prebuilt Libraries such as Numpy to do scientific calculations, Scipy for advanced computing, and Pybrain for machine learning (Python Machine Learning), making it among the top languages for AI.PortabilityPython is platform-independent and hence is among the most versatile and well-known solutions for numerous platforms and technologies, with few alterations to the foundations of coding.Quality of SoftwarePython offers the greatest flexibility among other programs, with the option of choosing among OOPs technique and scripting.Fun to Use Python is simple and supports a lot of libraries. It is easy to learn thus makes any programmer fun-loving. Productivity of DevelopersPython is easy to debug as its code is aound one-fifth of other Object Oriented Programming.Thus, Programmers can save their time to code with effective result. . Summary . Python is an important programming language for AI because it includes strong frameworks, such as Machine Learning in Python, which satisfies practically all of the standards in this field. It is one of the easiest and most effective visualization tools available. AI demands a lot of studies to test an innovative idea but another programming language will never be able to accomplish the project successfully. With twenty to thirty lines of code, almost any concept can be validated in Python. This makes it an incredibly helpful language for advancing AI.Python is the best AI programming language, and this makes it obvious. Python offers relevance for many additional objectives in addition to being the best AI programming language. .",

            "title": "Some basic Git-bash commands",
            "content": "Git-Bash Commands . Introduction . An application called Git Bash gives operating system users access to the Git command line. It is a command-line shell that enables git on the system’s command line. Version control systems and development processes are supported by the text editor VSCode. It offers resources so a user may create codes without difficulty. These act as prerequisites, thus one should be familiar with them. Git was initially created to facilitate collaboration among programmers working on source code throughout the software development process. Git is a distributed version-control system for monitoring changes in any set of files. Git command can be written either in Git-bash or itself in VS-Code terminal. Some of the basic Git-bash commands are as follow: . pwd . pwd command refers to print working directory. The complete path name of your current directory is written  by the pwd command . There is a / between each directory (slash). The first / stands for the root directory, and the last directory listed is the one you are currently in. . ls . ls command refers to list. All the list of files and folder inside the current directory is enlisted with the help of this command. . clear . clear command refers to clearing all the commands.This command is used to bring the command line on top of the computer terminal. . cd . cd command refers to current directory. It helps to display the current folder we are working on.Syntax for using cd command is: cd F : // . mkdir . mkdir command refers to make directory. Directory refers to any folder.We can make any folder using mkdir command.Syntax for using mkdir command is: mkdir “foldername”If we don’t want to use double quotation mark for, we an simple write name of folder using _ sign.for example:mkdir folder_nameQuestion to arise1. What if we don’t use _ sign?- If we don’t use _ sign while writing folder name and simply write mkdir folder name, then there will be two folder created with name folder and name. . cd.. . cd.. command refers to go back. This command is used to return back from existing directory path. . touch . touch command is used to create a file inside any folder.Syntax to create file inside any folder:touch “file name.extension” . rm . rm command refers to remove.This command is used to remove ani file inside the folder.Syntax to remove file from any folder:rm “file name” . rm -rf . rm -rf command refers to remove with recursive force. This command is used to remove a complete folder with its all file.Syntax to remove folder:rm -rf “folder name” . Summary of using Git-bash command in VS-Code . Git bash command are useful way to work faster by the programmer. Developer doesn’t want to spend their time working with computers basic functionality . They simply want to code the function to work easier in the program.Insted of going all way around to create new folder, file, delete, modify and other various work we can simply write code for these kind of setup in terminal. Terminal provides us platform to crete shortcut basis to work in the text-editor. |",
